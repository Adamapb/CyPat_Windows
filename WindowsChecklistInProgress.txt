11. Process check
	a. run "netstat -anb 5"('o' apendage will show PID) and check for unusual output//port numbers. Double-check listening ports are req'd.
	b. run "tasklist", same process.
	c. "netstat" -ano -p *protocolname* 5" can search tasks by protocol, can be used in conjunction with readme data
	d. you can use the task manager to sort tasks by memory usage
	e. use "www.processlibrary.com" to determine if processes are legitimate.

12. Patch management/misc

18. final misc 
	a. install microsoft service packs. Can be found through google.
		
		
		
		
Notes/If Stuck:
-Use event viewer (Path: ControlPanel>SystemAndSecurity>AdministrativeTools>EventViewer) for forensics as needed.
-Review task scheduler. Always run a restart before stopping scoring.		
-use run to launch "msconfg.exe to show programs that run on startup
-If lost, cross-reference categories you've earned points in with vulnerability categories from previous seasons to form an idea of what you're missing. Adam can get them for you.
-Look at resource usage in task manager
-review listening ports with "netstat -aonb", look at PID and corresponding process in task manager if necessary
-netstat will also show the origin file of a process. Be sure to kill the origin process AND add a firewall rule for that port, if needed.
-Try superantispyware
-use malwarebytes anti-rootkit
-make sure no accounts are "password never expires"
